A cracked Minecraft Launcher I made for no reason.
If you want the simple way, install pip, install requests using pip, download the main.py file and run it with Python3.
## EDIT 1
If you want to change your username now, go to Settings then Change username. After you've changed your name, it should appear in-game.

## EDIT 2
I migrated UI libraries from Textual to Tkinter, so if you want the original Textual version, just add `--textual` to the main.py arguments. Like this: `python3 main.py --textual`
